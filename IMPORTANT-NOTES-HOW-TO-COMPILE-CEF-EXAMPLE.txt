These notes explain how i managed to work with the CEF integration example on 2019...

Observations:
I cloned the CEF-Integration git repo and followed the instructions, and compiled the entire Urho3D with the given sample layout.

I used Urho3D 1.6, the exact CEF distro shipped with the CEF sample on the repo and Visual Studio 2017.

The fact that I used VS 2017 is because it allowd me to compile as 32bit.
It only worked with 32bit target compilation.

Then i created a prorject for CMake to dev with VS code IDE using CMake Tools.

On VS Code, be sure to set the Cmake target to run on Release, this can be changed on the botton bar, (that turn orange when running)...

Also, be sure to use the same compiler used to generate the code for Urho3D.lib and CEF libs... in this case was VS2017.
Most important of all, use the 32bit version... thats about it.
