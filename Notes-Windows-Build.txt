Windows is tricky.



For all cases, windows binaries are limited to 32bit oNLY
To build the engine, ensure you have lamenet libs, to build them:
	lamenet on MinGW:
		Install Go-lang, must build with 32bit arch, that might only be possible with a 32bit go installation
		Install MinGW 32bit with gcc 5.10 on C:/MinGW
	
	lamenet on MSVC:
		Tested with MSVC 2019 community
		Install VSCODE
		Build the lamenet as .dll
		convert the dll to lib
		when compiling Domefy with a MSVC, the headers generated by go may cause errors, just comment the lines that cause the error out

CEF works ONLY with MSVC 2019 32 bit

IMPORTANT, Urho3D lib for MSVC May not be included, due to its size, it may be needed to be download separatedely, for cef, it MUST be version 1.7 32Bit With Direct3D11 Static


in short, for windows, it all got to be 32bit, sorry.
