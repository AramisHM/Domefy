Windows is tricky.

Before anything, should you build lamenet, you will have to do so with 32bit arch, Go will attempt to use 64bit symbols. By using a 32bit install go, I was able to compile lamenet for windows 32bit (using IE11 virtual machine)

After that, ming32 with gcc 5.10, will compile and link fine.

CEF is MSVC 2019 (i guess) 32 bit ONLY.

in short, for windows, it all got to be 32bit, sorry.
